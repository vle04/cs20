    I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam but grew up in Medford, 
    Massachusetts.

        This is an image of a cafe I went to in Japan, it is one of my favorite
        places because of the comfortable and calm atmosphere, as well as really
        great tea drinks, which was paired with fresh mochi! I liked this cafe 
        so much that I came back a second time, and the workers were very
        welcoming!

        I think that no one would expect that I live only 10-15 minutes away
        from campus.
